Polaris Server
====
*So cool we are already on Episode 2 before Episode 1 was done*
PolarisServer is an Open Source private server for the Japanese MMORPG Phantasy Star Online 2. **It is currently under heavy development and is nowhere playable yet.**

**TODO** Talk about contributing here

## Building
For the time being, we only support using mono in order to build Polaris. You need to have MonoDevelop 4 / Xamarin studio installed. You also need the Mono runtime, even on Windows!

After installing MD / Xamarin and setting up the Mono runtime, open the solution and build!

In the future we will hopefully have a buildserver, xbuild / msbuild support and other fancy things.
